# Contributing
Mentors can contribute to this repository to create more complicated tasks for the mentees. 

## Guideline

## New Task
1. Check if the task does not already exist in some form. 
2. Add the task in two places - under `Readme.md`: Index and Task list.
3. The task should have a name and description of what the user will learn, followed by numerically bulleted steps.
4. The tasks should involve modifying their mark-down file only.
5. Submit a pull request.

## Update an existing task
1. Create an issue regarding the problem with the task description
2. Make the changes.
3. Submit a pull request.

_Thank you mentors for being here!_
