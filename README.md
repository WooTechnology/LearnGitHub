- [ ] [Pull-requests](#pull-requests)
- [ ] [Branches](#branches)

### Request for collaboration permission
This task will teach you how to create an issue, and also add you to the collaborators of this repository.

1. Visit the 'Issues' tab under this repository. Create an issue requesting for collaboration permission. Wait for it to be granted

### Cloning
This task will teach you how to clone a repository. You may chose to do it via the terminal or git-GUI.

1. Clone this repository on your local.
2. Create a new file. Save it in the current repository with your name or userId e.g. `wooTech.md`
3. Introduce yourself in the file in two lines, and copy paste the [Tasks] from this file, check the one's that you have done.
4. Do a git add, commit and push it to the remote repository on github. Make sure you do not mess with other users files.

### Pull-requests
This task will teach you how to fork a repository and create a pull request. As you would have notices, anyone can damage existing files on the repository by makes a wrong push and commit. One way to handle the situation is to revert all changes - but git also provides you a better way for collaboration by seperating the new changes from the previously accepted changes.

1. Fork this repository. You will see an identical copy of this repository in your github page.
2. Clone it to your local.
3. In your introduction file, add another line on why you want to learn coding. Check the pull-reuqests task. Save it.
4. Do a git add, commit and push. 
5. You will see changes appear in the copy of the repository on your github page.
6. If there are no merge conflicts, github will give you the option to create a pull request.
7. Create a pull-request, assign your WooTech mentor (if present) to review the request and that's it.

### Branches
This task will teach you how to create a branch, work on it, push to it and create a pull request to merge the branch with the master.

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a new branch with your `<name>-branch` e.g. 'wooTech-branch'
3. Edit you info file by adding a linw about your experience with github so far.
4. Do a git add, commit and push.
5. Visit the remote repository on github. Under branches - navigate to your branch. 
6. Ensure changes are reflected, and create a pull-request.
7. Once you changes are approves by your mentor, you will merge and squash the branch.
